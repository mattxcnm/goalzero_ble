## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components

### Device Registry (`device_registry.py`)
- **Purpose**: Central registry for device type detection and configuration
- **Features**: 
  - Regex pattern matching for device names
  - Device class factory creation
  - Command/handle mapping per device type
  - Extensible for future devices

### BLE Manager (`ble_manager.py`)
- **Purpose**: Handles all Bluetooth Low Energy communication
- **Features**:
  - Device discovery and connection management
  - GATT handle-based communication
  - Command sending with response collection
  - Connection lifecycle management

### Device Classes (`devices/`)
- **Base Class**: Abstract device interface with common functionality
- **Alta80Device**: Fridge-specific sensors, buttons, and data parsing
- **Yeti500Device**: Power station sensors, buttons, and data parsing
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new device types

### Coordinator (`coordinator.py`)
- **Purpose**: Data update coordination and entity state management
- **Features**:
  - Configurable update intervals
  - Device-specific data fetching
  - Error handling and recovery
  - Entity value provision

### Config Flow (`config_flow.py`)
- **Purpose**: User interface for device setup and configuration
- **Features**:
  - Automatic bluetooth discovery
  - Manual device entry with validation
  - Update interval configuration
  - Reconfiguration support

### Entity Platforms (`sensor.py`, `button.py`)
- **Purpose**: Dynamic entity creation based on device capabilities
- **Features**:
  - Device-driven sensor definitions
  - Automatic button creation from device commands
  - Proper Home Assistant entity attributes
  - Device info integration

## üìä Data Flow

1. **Discovery**: Bluetooth devices are detected by HA's bluetooth integration
2. **Validation**: Device names are matched against supported patterns
3. **Setup**: User configures device with update interval
4. **Connection**: BLE manager establishes GATT connection
5. **Updates**: Coordinator requests device data at configured intervals
6. **Parsing**: Device classes parse responses into sensor values
7. **Entities**: Sensors/buttons update with latest data

## üîß Command System

Commands are modular and extensible:

```python
DEVICE_COMMANDS = {
    DEVICE_TYPE_ALTA80: {
        "status_request": "FEFE03010200",
        "temp_down": "FEFE040501020600", 
        "temp_up": "FEFE040500020500",
        "power_on": "FEFE050100000000",
        # ... more commands
    },
    DEVICE_TYPE_YETI500: {
        "status_request": "FEFE03010200",
        # ... device-specific commands
    }
}
```

## üß© Adding New Devices

To add support for a new Goal Zero device:

1. **Add Pattern**: Update device patterns in `device_registry.py`
2. **Create Device Class**: Implement new device class in `devices/`
3. **Define Commands**: Add GATT handles and command payloads to `const.py`
4. **Register Device**: Update device registry mappings
5. **Test**: Device will automatically be discoverable

## üîó Integration Points

- **Home Assistant Bluetooth**: Uses HA's bluetooth integration for discovery
- **Config Entries**: Proper config entry lifecycle management
- **Entity Registry**: Dynamic entity creation/removal
- **Device Registry**: Proper device information and relationships
- **Update Coordinator**: Efficient data polling with error handling
