# Yeti 500 Integration Summary

## What Has Been Implemented

### ‚úÖ Device Detection & Auto-Discovery
- **Pattern Recognition**: Yeti 500 devices are automatically detected by name pattern `gzy5c-[A-F0-9]{6}`
- **Case Insensitive**: Works with any case combination (e.g., `GZY5C-AABBCCDDEEFF`, `gzy5c-aabbccddeeff`)
- **Validation**: Invalid device names are properly rejected
- **Registry Integration**: Fully integrated with the existing device registry system

### ‚úÖ Home Assistant Integration
- **Config Flow**: Yeti 500 devices appear in auto-discovery as "Yeti 500 (gzy5c-...)"
- **Device Creation**: Devices are properly created and registered in Home Assistant
- **Connection Management**: BLE connection establishment and maintenance
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of connection failures and errors

### ‚úÖ GATT Discovery & Logging
- **Service Discovery**: Complete GATT service and characteristic discovery
- **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all discovered services, characteristics, and handles
- **Protocol Analysis**: Detailed information logged for future entity development
- **Connection Info**: All connection details printed to debug logs

### ‚úÖ Device Framework
- **Base Implementation**: Complete Yeti500Device class extending GoalZeroDevice
- **Discovery Phase**: Minimal entity structure optimized for discovery and analysis
- **Data Structure**: Basic data handling and parsing framework ready for expansion
- **Command Interface**: Framework ready for command implementation once protocol is analyzed

## What Gets Logged

When a Yeti 500 device connects, the following information is logged at DEBUG level:

```
=== Yeti 500 Connection and Discovery ===
Device Name: gzy5c-AABBCCDDEEFF
Device Address: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
Establishing connection to Yeti 500...
Successfully connected to Yeti 500
Discovering GATT services for Yeti 500...

=== Yeti 500 GATT Analysis ===
Found X services:
  Service: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
    Char: yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy (Handle: 0x001A, Props: ['read', 'write', 'notify'])
      ‚Üí Potential WRITE characteristic
      ‚Üí Potential NOTIFY characteristic
    [... more characteristics ...]

=== Yeti 500 Ready for Entity Development ===
Connection established and GATT services mapped
Next step: Analyze device protocol and create appropriate entities
```

## How to Test

1. **Install Integration**: Install the updated integration in Home Assistant
2. **Enable Debug Logging**: Add to `configuration.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   logger:
     logs:
       custom_components.goalzero_ble: debug
   ```
3. **Add Device**: Go to Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration > Goal Zero BLE
4. **Check Auto-Discovery**: Look for Yeti 500 devices in the discovered devices list
5. **Review Logs**: Check Home Assistant logs for detailed GATT discovery information

## Next Development Steps

1. **Protocol Analysis**: 
   - Review the logged GATT characteristics
   - Identify write/notify characteristics for commands/responses
   - Test basic command sending and response collection

2. **Entity Development**:
   - Create sensor entities based on discovered data format
   - Add control entities (buttons, switches, selects, numbers) as needed
   - Implement proper state reading and command generation

3. **Testing & Validation**:
   - Test with real Yeti 500 device
   - Validate entity states and control functionality
   - Refine based on actual device behavior

## File Changes Made

- **`devices/yeti500.py`**: Updated with discovery-focused implementation
- **`README.md`**: Added Yeti 500 documentation and status information
- **`test_yeti500_patterns.py`**: Created test script for pattern validation

## Current Status

üîç **Discovery Phase Complete** - Ready for protocol analysis and entity development!

The Yeti 500 integration is now set up to:
- Auto-discover and connect to Yeti 500 devices
- Log comprehensive GATT information for analysis  
- Provide a foundation for future entity development
- Show proper device identification in Home Assistant UI

No entities are created yet, allowing for clean analysis of the device's actual capabilities and protocol structure.
