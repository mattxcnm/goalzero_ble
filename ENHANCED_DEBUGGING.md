# Enhanced Debugging and Timeout Improvements

## Changes Made to Address Connection and Response Issues

### 1. **Increased Timeouts**
- **Command response wait**: 3s â†’ 8s (for first response)
- **Total response timeout**: 12s â†’ 20s
- **Command retry attempts**: 2 â†’ 3
- **Notification setup delay**: 0.5s â†’ 1.0s

### 2. **Enhanced Command Strategy**
- **Multiple command variants**: Try different command formats in case device expects different protocol:
  - `FEFE03010200` (standard)
  - `FEFE030102` (without length byte)
  - `FEFE0301020000` (with padding)

### 3. **Device Responsiveness Testing**
- **Probe command**: Send simple `FEFE` before main commands to test if device is awake
- **Write operation validation**: Check if GATT write operations succeed

### 4. **Alternative Data Retrieval**
- **Direct characteristic reading**: If notifications fail, try reading directly from all readable characteristics
- **Fallback mechanism**: Multiple approaches to get data from device

### 5. **Enhanced Logging**
- **Notification handler**: Now uses INFO level with emoji (ðŸ””) for better visibility
- **Command attempts**: Detailed logging of each command variant tried
- **GATT operations**: Detailed success/failure logging for all BLE operations
- **Timing information**: Shows exact response times

### 6. **Better Error Recovery**
- **Graceful write failures**: Continue to next attempt if command write fails
- **Multiple read strategies**: Try notification + direct read approaches

## What the Logs Will Now Show

### Success Case:
```
âœ“ Notifications started successfully
âœ“ Probe command sent successfully
âœ“ Device responded to probe command
Sending command attempt 1: FEFE03010200 (Standard status command) to handle 0x0025
âœ“ Command sent successfully
ðŸ”” Alta 80 Notification 1 from 0x0025: [response data] (18 bytes)
âœ“ Got response on command attempt 1 (Standard status command) after 1.2s
```

### Failure Case with Detailed Diagnosis:
```
âœ“ Notifications started successfully
âœ“ Probe command sent successfully
No response to probe command - device may be sleeping or unresponsive
Sending command attempt 1: FEFE03010200 (Standard status command) to handle 0x0025
âœ“ Command sent successfully
No response to command attempt 1 (Standard status command) after 8s, retrying...
Trying alternative approach: direct characteristic read...
```

## Expected Behavior Changes

1. **Longer wait times** should handle slow-responding devices
2. **Multiple command formats** should handle protocol variations
3. **Direct reads** should work even if notifications are broken
4. **Enhanced logging** should pinpoint exactly where communication fails

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Look for the ðŸ”” emoji** in logs - this confirms notifications are working
2. **Check command send confirmations** - "âœ“ Command sent successfully"
3. **Monitor probe responses** - indicates if device is responsive at all
4. **Watch for direct read attempts** - fallback data retrieval method

This should help identify whether the issue is:
- Device sleeping/unresponsive
- Wrong command format
- Notification system broken
- GATT write operations failing
- Or something else entirely
