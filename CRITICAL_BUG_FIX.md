# CRITICAL BUG FIX: Missing Response Collection

## Issue Discovered
A critical bug was found in the Alta 80 device implementation that prevented any BLE responses from being captured and processed, even if the device was responding correctly.

## Root Cause
In `custom_components/goalzero_ble/devices/alta80.py`, the `notification_handler` function was:
1. ✅ Correctly receiving BLE notifications from the device
2. ✅ Correctly logging the responses with `_LOGGER.debug()`
3. ✅ Correctly incrementing the `response_count`
4. ❌ **NOT storing responses in the `responses` list for processing**

## The Bug
```python
def notification_handler(sender, data):
    nonlocal response_count, responses
    response_count += 1
    hex_data = data.hex().upper()
    _LOGGER.debug("Alta 80 Response %d: %s", response_count, hex_data)
    # BUG: Missing responses.append(hex_data)
```

This meant:
- The device could have been responding correctly all along
- Responses were being logged but never stored for parsing
- The integration would always return default/None values
- The issue appeared as "no response from device" when actually "responses not captured"

## The Fix
```python
def notification_handler(sender, data):
    nonlocal response_count, responses
    response_count += 1
    hex_data = data.hex().upper()
    responses.append(hex_data)  # CRITICAL FIX: Actually store the response!
    _LOGGER.debug("Alta 80 Response %d: %s", response_count, hex_data)
```

## Impact
This bug explains why:
- All previous test attempts showed "no responses"
- The device seemed completely unresponsive
- All troubleshooting focused on connection/discovery issues
- Test scripts worked (they had the correct `responses.append()` call)

## Verification Needed
With this fix:
1. The Alta 80 device should now respond correctly
2. Status bytes should be properly parsed and exposed as sensors
3. The integration should work as designed

## Next Steps
1. Test the integration with this critical fix applied
2. Enable debug logging to confirm responses are now being captured
3. Verify that all 36 status bytes are properly parsed and displayed as sensors

## Lessons Learned
- Always verify that data collection logic actually stores collected data
- Be suspicious when test scripts work but main code doesn't
- Debug logging can be misleading if it occurs before data storage
