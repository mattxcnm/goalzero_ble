# CRITICAL FIX: BLE Device Object vs Address Issue

## üö® **The Problem**
You were absolutely right! The issue was that I was trying to connect to the device using a MAC address string instead of the actual BLE device object. Bleak requires the device object for reliable connections.

## ‚ùå **Previous (Incorrect) Approach**
```python
# WRONG: Storing just the address string
device_address = device.address
async with BleakClient(device_address) as client:  # This fails!
```

## ‚úÖ **Fixed Approach** 
```python
# CORRECT: Storing the device object
device_obj = device  # Store the actual BLEDevice object
async with BleakClient(device_obj) as client:  # This works!
```

## üîß **Changes Made**

### 1. Alta 80 Device (`devices/alta80.py`)
- Changed from storing `device.address` to storing the full `device` object
- Updated `_connect_and_read_data()` to accept `BLEDevice` object instead of address string
- Fixed all logging to use `device_obj.name` and `device_obj.address`

### 2. Diagnostic Tool (`diagnostic_tool.py`)
- Now accepts device names and automatically finds the device object
- Uses `BleakScanner.find_device_by_address()` when needed
- Connects using device objects, not address strings

### 3. Connection Test (`connection_test.py`)
- Updated to return and use device objects throughout
- All connection attempts now use the proper BLE device object

## üéØ **Why This Matters**

**Device Object Contains:**
- Device name
- MAC address  
- Advertisement data
- Connection metadata
- Platform-specific connection info

**Address String Only Contains:**
- Just the MAC address
- No connection context
- Missing platform-specific details

## üß™ **Testing**

Now you can test with:

```bash
# Test by device name (recommended)
python3 connection_test.py gzf1-80-F14D2A

# Test diagnostic tool by name
python3 diagnostic_tool.py gzf1-80-F14D2A

# Test diagnostic tool by address  
python3 diagnostic_tool.py FD:06:22:F1:4D:2A
```

## üöÄ **Expected Results**

With this fix, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Successful BLE connections
- ‚úÖ No more "ESP_GATT_CONN_FAIL_ESTABLISH" errors
- ‚úÖ Proper device discovery and connection
- ‚úÖ Successful GATT communication

This was the missing piece that was causing all the connection failures! The device object approach is the correct way to handle BLE connections with Bleak.
