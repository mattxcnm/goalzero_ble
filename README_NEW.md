- **Availability**: Smart availability logic handling connect/disconnect patterns
- **Updates**: Configurable update intervals with coordinator pattern

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Device Not Found
- **Power Check**: Ensure Goal Zero device is powered on and active
- **Range**: Move device closer to Home Assistant server (BLE range ~10-30 feet)
- **Name Match**: For manual setup, device name must match exactly (case-sensitive)
- **Restart**: Try restarting the Goal Zero device and Home Assistant

### Connection Issues
- **Update Interval**: Reduce update frequency if experiencing disconnections (try 60+ seconds)
- **Interference**: Ensure no other apps/devices are connected to the Goal Zero device
- **Logs**: Check Home Assistant logs for specific BLE error messages
- **Bluetooth**: Restart Home Assistant's Bluetooth service if needed

### Sensor Values Unavailable
- **Device State**: Some sensors may not be available depending on device operational state
- **Communication**: Verify BLE communication is working in Home Assistant logs
- **Response Parsing**: Check logs for GATT response parsing errors
- **Recovery**: Integration will automatically retry failed commands and reconnect

### Common Error Messages
- **"Timeout waiting for connect response"**: Device out of range or busy
- **"GATT handle not found"**: GATT discovery may have failed, check logs
- **"No response from device"**: Device may be sleeping or disconnected
- **"AttributeError in sensor"**: Fixed in latest version, ensure you're updated

### Debug Logging
Enable debug logging to diagnose issues:

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.goalzero_ble: debug
    bleak: debug
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Disclaimer
This is an **unofficial integration** not affiliated with Goal Zero. The integration was developed through reverse engineering of BLE protocols and may not work with all firmware versions or device configurations. Use at your own risk.

### Device Compatibility
- **Firmware**: Integration tested with specific firmware versions - newer updates may change protocols
- **Models**: Limited to tested device models (Alta 80, Yeti 500) - other models may have different protocols
- **Region**: Device behavior may vary by region or configuration

### Privacy & Security
- **Local Communication**: All communication is local via Bluetooth - no cloud services involved
- **Data Handling**: Device data remains within your Home Assistant instance
- **No Authentication**: BLE communication uses Goal Zero's open protocol (no encryption)
